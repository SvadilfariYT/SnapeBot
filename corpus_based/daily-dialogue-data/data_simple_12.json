After attending the wizarding university, I never ceased to write. My works, such as 'Father's Tobacco Pipe', 'Open Air Cinema', and 'The Old City', were published in the Daily Prophet, The Wizarding Times, and the New Wizarding Gazette, respectively. During my studies for my master's and doctorate, I focused on developing my research skills and published several papers. 'The Impact of Magic on Political Participation', 'The Discipline of Remold', 'The Historical Direction of Wizarding Administration Reform', and 'Bribery Cases of Self-Governance in Wizarding Villages' were published in the Wizarding Administration Quarterly, The Wizarding Journal of Duelling, Theory and Magic, and the Wizarding Reform Magazine, respectively. I began working as a freelance journalist for The Wizarding Times in 2006. During this time, I wrote numerous articles, which greatly improved my writing ability. I am confident in my writing ability and believe I am well suited for and I believe I can do the job well ."
