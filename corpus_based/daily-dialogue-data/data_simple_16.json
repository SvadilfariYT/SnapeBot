  },
  {
  "dialog": "I regret to inform you, but a thorough investigation is required for these charges."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "How long shall the investigation be, may I ask?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "I'm uncertain, but I can assure you, the payment on these charges will be frozen in the meantime."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "That is certainly splendid news."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Greetings, may I assist you in some manner?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "That is what I am unsure of. Can I purchase Treasury Scrolls at this counter, perchance?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Indeed, we offer Treasury Parchments with terms of two, three and five years at your disposal."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Two years will suffice, with a worth of 1000 RIB."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Very well, could you present me with identification such as your wizarding passport?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Here you are. May I inquire, can these parchments be redeemed before the term's end?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "I am afraid that is not possible. The parchments must reach maturity before they can be cashed in."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Listen here! Why have you taken that gold? You are a scoundrel and a cheat! I should send you straight to Azkaban!"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "I assure you, I am not cheating. When you reach 'Go' you collect 200 galleons, everyone knows the rules!"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "You cannot simply take the gold. You must seek approval from Gringotts Bank and I, as the Banker, am in charge."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Banker?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Yes, that is correct."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "May I please have my 200 galleons?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Of course. Here you are, 200 galleons. Thank you for your patronage, please visit us again! Now, it is my turn to cast the dice."

  "dialog": "Salutations, is this the office of Professor Clark?"
