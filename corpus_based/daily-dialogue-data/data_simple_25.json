  },
  {
  "dialog": "I'm afraid you'll just have to be patient. I won't move my broomstick until the Ministry arrives. I'll pop into one of these nearby wizarding homes and use their fireplace to contact them. Don't worry, you'll make it to St. Mungo's in time."

  "dialog": "It hurts quite badly."
