  "dialog": "Nope, sorry."

  {
  "dialog": "That's one more gold coin, friend."

  {
  "dialog": "I have, but I must say the one I had at that particular eatery was not exactly appetizing. The fish was undercooked and a bit too salty."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Yeah, I know what you mean. I think the chef didn't allocate enough time for steaming and used too much of a certain herb."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "I agree. But let's not dwell on that, shall we? Please give this one a try."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Thank you! Mmm, this is delicious!"
  },

  "dialog": "Glad you like it! Your approval means a lot to me."
  },
  {
  "dialog": "Aside from steamed fish, what other dishes are you skilled in?"
  },
  {
  "dialog": "I'm quite talented in creating dishes such as beef stew with potatoes, fried chicken, hot and sour soup, and the like."
