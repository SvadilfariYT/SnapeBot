  },
  {
  "dialog": "It is my understanding that the distance to London is 180 kilometers from here. At a brisk pace on the highway, the trip should take no more than two hours."
  },

  "dialog": "Of course, unless there are delays from heavy traffic. In that case, it may take us three hours."

  "dialog": "If memory serves, it is over five meters in length. I cannot recall the exact measurement. It is capable of reaching speeds greater than 200 kilometers per hour."
